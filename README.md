# Free Web Search Bot

A Facebook Messenger bot for people without access to the Internet outside the Free Facebook network such as users in developing countries. They can perform simple search queries, after which the bot will reply with a list of results. The grand goal is to prevent spreading of disinformation and combat fake news, which is most prevalent in places with limited access to information in the web.
