# Free Web Search Bot

A Facebook Messenger bot for people without access to the internet outside the free Facebook network such as users in developing countries. They can perform simple search queries and a list of results will appear. The grand goal is to combat and prevent spreading of misinformation and fake news, which is prevalent in people with limited access to information in the web.
